        Concealed from the view of the moribund mass of humanity, hidden in the
        darkness of the gates of Hell, waiting to spread the evil sound of the
        extermination of life is the most powerful and misanthropic force.<br />
        Fed by hatred, loudness and alcohol, the four headed monster of
        Apocalypse will destroy everything on its way with its unwavering wall
        of sound. Like the scream of Satan himself the fury of the troopers of
        doom is deafening, intoxicating and damned addicting.<br />
        Feel the ethylic vapor impregnating the audience, be conquered by the
        slow devastating groove, chant the name of Lucifer, dance with us on
        heavy riffing and worship the soundtrack of the end of days.<br />
        CULT OF OCCULT plays for black masses, sacrifices, satanic rituals, dark
        ceremonies and unholy meetings. <br />
